\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Herbert Bos, for giving me the opportunity
to develop my Master project in the Systems and Network Security Group.

Moreover, I would like to thank all members of the VUsec, in particular
Cristiano Giuffrida and Kaveh Razavi, for their help, discussions and
stimulating knowledge provided.
